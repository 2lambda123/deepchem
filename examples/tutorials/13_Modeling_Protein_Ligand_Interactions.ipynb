Frey](https://ncfrey.github.io/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nc_frey) and [Bharath Ramsundar](https://rbharath.github.io/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rbhar90)\n","\n","In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the use of machine learning and molecular docking methods to predict the binding energy of a protein-ligand complex. Recall that a ligand is some small molecule which interacts (usually non-covalently) with a protein. Molecular docking performs geometric calculations to find a “binding pose” with a small molecule interacting with a protein in a suitable binding pocket (that is, a region on the protein which has a groove in which the small molecule can rest). \n","\n","The structure of proteins can be determined experimentally with techniques like Cryo-EM or X-ray crystallography. This can be a powerful tool for structure-based drug discovery. For more info on docking, read the [AutoDock Vina paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3041641/) and the [`deepchem.dock`](https://deepchem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docking.html) documentation. There are many graphical user and command line interfaces (like AutoDock) for performing molecular docking. Here, we show how docking can be performed programmatically with DeepChem, which enables automation and easy integration with machine learning pipelines.\n","\n","As you work through the tutorial, you'll trace an arc including \n","1. Loading a protein-ligand complex dataset ([PDBbind](http://www.pdbbind.org.cn/)) \n","2. Performing programmatic molecular docking\n","3. Featurizing protein-ligand complexes with interaction fingerprints\n","4. Fitting a random forest model and predicting binding affinities\n","\n","To start the tutorial, we'll use a simple pre-processed dataset file that comes in the form of a gzipped file. Each row is a molecular system, and each column represents a different piece of information about that system. For instance, in this example, every row reflects a protein-ligand complex, and the following columns are present: a unique complex identifier; the SMILES string of the ligand; the binding affinity (Ki) of the ligand to the protein in the complex; a Python `list` of all lines in a PDB file for the protein alone; and a Python `list` of all lines in a ligand file for the ligand alone.\n","\n","## Colab\n","\n","This tutorial and the rest in this sequence are designed to be done in Google colab. If you'd like to open this notebook in colab, you can use the following link.\n","\n","[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepchem/deepchem/blob/master/examples/tutorials/13_Modeling_Protein_Ligand_Interactions.ipynb)\n","\n","## Setup\n","\n","To run DeepChem within Colab, you'll need to run the following cell of installation commands. This will take about 5 minutes to run to completion and install your environment."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"0rmMEPOsRIN1","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1610740868291,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":22046,"user":{"displayName":"Nathan
